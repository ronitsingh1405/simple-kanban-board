    <h1>Kanban Board<br>Simple App for Learning Purposes!</h1>
    <h3>This is a simple kanban app for learning purposes. A Kanban board is one of the tools that can be used to implement Kanban to manage work at a personal or organizational level. They visually depict work at various stages of a process using cards to represent work items and columns to represent each stage of the process. This app makes it easier to learn them.

    <h2>Main Components of the Kanban board</h2>
    <h3><u>Kanban Cards</u> – This is the visual representation of tasks. Each card contains information about the task and its status such as deadline, assignee, description, etc.

        <br><u>Kanban Columns</u> – Each column on the board represents a different stage of your workflow. The cards go through the workflow until their full completion.
        
        <br><u>Work-in-Progress Limits</u> – They restrict the maximum amount of tasks in the different stages of the workflow. Limiting WIP allows you to finish work items faster, by helping your team to focus only on current tasks.
        
        <br><u>Kanban Swimlanes</u> – These are horizontal lanes you can use to separate different types of activities, teams, classes of service, and so on.
        
        <br>If you are new to the method, you may start with a simple board structure and split it into three basic sections that show different stages of the workflow.
